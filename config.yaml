      I am a software engineer student with a passion for complex systems. I have a background in computer engineering and software engineering, and I have a strong interest in physics. I am currently studying at [KTH](https://kth.se/en) in Stockholm, Sweden. 

      I am currently working on my thesis, focused on fine-tuning Large Language Models for synthesizing Solidity code in smart contract development.

                  - Developed a Quantum Key Distribution simulator, to exchange symmetric keys, based on BB84 in Python.
                  - Developed the backend for the simulator with peer-to-peer and client-server architectures using Redis and Flask
                  - Forked gRPC and reimplemented its transport level using my simulator to provide post-quantum encryption
                  - Integrated my simulator into federated learning frameworks (OpenFL, Flower) and into a medical data homomorphic encryption system.
